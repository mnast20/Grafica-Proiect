# Grafica-Proiect

Project realized for a Graphics Course hosted by Luxoft in collaboration with the summer school 3D UPB.

A reference image was used for the design of the table. A few tweaks were made however, in order to experiment as much as I can with the 3DS Max and 3D Substance Painter Tools.

I generated the Low Poly Model, as well as the High Poly Model in 3DS Max, and then imported the models in 3D Substance Painter, where the textures were created. I used a HDRI from Poly Haven (https://polyhaven.com/) for the lighting.
